		What does the skin appearance depend on? For the correct skin care, we have to know what it consists of. The skin is a very complex human organ and plays important role in the organism functioning. It takes part in metabolism, regulates body temperature, performs secretory function and protects other organs. The skin is the barrier from adverse impacts: bacteria, harmful chemical substances etc. Every person has the same structure and functions of the skin, but the individual skin appearance depends on many factors.
		<h2 class="page-subtitle-1">Skin Structure</h2>
		The skin consists of 3 layers:
		epidermis, derma and hypoderm (subcutaneous fat).

		<h3 class="page-subtitle-2">Epidermis</h3>
		A surface layer of the skin. First of all, when we look at the skin, we see surface layer and the skin appearance depends on epidermis condition a lot.
		<h3 class="page-subtitle-2">Derma</h3>
		Performs the frame function. That’s why it has an important value for skin appearance. First of all, derma includes fibers, which are responsible for skin elasticity and springiness – collagen and elastin. If stretch the young skin (it requires enough effort) and then release, it will turn back to the condition before stretching. Stretching the skin becomes easier while deterioration of the fiber and return to the initial state of the skin takes more time. Derma also includes the substances which retain water as sponge. Condition of the derma, its elasticity and resistance to mechanic load are determined by conditions of the collagen, elastin and by the quality of the water gel (hyaluronic acid).
		<h3 class="page-subtitle-2">Hypoderm</h3>
		Hypoderm or subcutaneous fat consists of the loose connective tissue, where fat deposits. Nerve endings, blood and lymph vessels are settled in hypoderm.

		Hyaluronic acid is one of the most important elements of the intercellular substance in both upper skin layers and is responsible for skin moisturizing, elasticity and metabolism. Approximately, starting from the age of 30 hyaluronic acid synthesis starts to decrease. Skin elasticity starts to reduce, dehydration starts, wrinkles appear, complexion deterioration etc. This is facilitated by many factors:
